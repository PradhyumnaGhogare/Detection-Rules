# Arcenum Systems — Universal SIEM Detection Rules

> **Author:** Pradhyumna Ghogare  
> **Copyright:** © 2024 Pradhyumna Ghogare / Arcenum Systems  
> **Project:** Arcenum Systems Universal Threat Detection Engine  
> **Version:** 3.0.0  
> **MITRE ATT&CK:** v14.0

## Overview

Production-grade, real-world APT-based detection rules for all major SIEM platforms.  
Every rule is based on **documented threat actor behavior from actual incidents**.  
Each rule includes `WHY THIS FIRES` — so your SOC knows exactly who is in the environment.
